# PhySiLight-Tools
A Collection of various programs, tools and utilities I have developed over the course of my physics studies.

## 🤔 About
>This repository is intended to grow as I develop and use more software tools during the course of my physics studies.
>
>Will include all sorts of programs, from data-analysis to physics simulations.\
>Functioning kind of like a miniature digital library

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run a tool:
1. Navigate to its folder.
2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the script: `python main.py`

Each tool has its own README with instructions.

### 📖 Currently relevant information you might want to know:
>I am at the end of my 1st year BSc in physics, so don't expect anything mind blowing.\
>I don't claim to know the full ins and outs of everything that I use.\
>This repository is a growing collection of small programs, tools, and utilities built during my physics undergrad — mostly in Python.


## 🧪 Quality and contribution
>I don't claim that any of the software here is "the best method" for solving a problem or simulating one.\
>You can probably find similar, if not better tools right here on GitHub.
>
>However I try to make sure that the programs do at least run, and work as expected.

### 🧮 Found a bug, inefficiency or error ?
>Feel free to contribute. These tools are here to be shared, and so that others can use and grow them.

### 📐 Want to add your own programs to this repository?
>Fork the repo, add them, then create a PR, with a description stating what the tool is, what it does, how it was built, and what it's based on.
>
>**Disclaimer** I do not track, catalog, or guarantee the data-security of any of these programs, nor do I have the expertise to do so.
>
>Do keep in mind that your software will then be subject to the [LICENSE](https://github.com/ieepirzy/PhySiLight-Tools/blob/24c327bf0fbcea9fcad01ccce54fcafa0ba7ec3d/LICENSE), with all stated addendums used by this repository.

# Culture

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each program or tool lives in its own folder.
```bash
Example:

/data-analysis/
└── fourier-transform-visualizer/
    ├── main.py
    ├── README.md
    └── example_output.png

/simulations/
└── projectile-motion/
    ├── motion_simulator.py
    ├── README.md
    └── results/
```
>
> Each folder should include:
> - A brief `README.md` describing the program (purpose, how to run it).
> - Example input/output files if relevant.
> - Dependencies in a `requirements.txt` or noted in the README.

## 🧠 Underlying Physics / Math

Many tools in this repo are based on the theory I’ve learned during my studies — mechanics, electromagnetism, statistics, and more.

Whenever possible, each tool’s README will also include:
- The equations/models used
- References (e.g. textbooks, lecture notes, or research papers)
- Limitations / assumptions
>Please try to use free and open resources.\
>If possible, include a simplified explanation so that non-experts can somewhat understand the purpose of the tool/utility.

## 💡 Code Philosophy
I will not police the code here, so this is more of a courtesy thing.
> Code should be readable, even if not perfect.\
> Comments are encouraged, especially for math-heavy logic.\
> When in doubt, document how it works.

Just a heads up — I don’t check it that often, so replies may be slow!
